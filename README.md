# LED-Device

A device that toggles through five states, activated with a button push:

1. Off
2. Full Brightness
3. Half Brightness
4. 1/4th Brightness
5. Flashing at 2 Hz

The MCU used was an ATMEGA328. The battery used had a supply voltage of 9V.

Note: the signal from the button to the MCU is missing; either fix the ECAD design or solder on a wire in the physical design as a workaround.
